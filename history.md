The Charlie Justmann Band/CJB Rock & Variety came into existence in 1947 when Charlie's Dad, Andy, played his first gig at the tender age of 16. Andy 'drafted' Charlie into his band at the age of 15. At that time the band was known as The Andy Justmann Orchestra and played Polkas, Big Band, Classic Rock and more. Andy retired from the band around 2010. Charlie had taken the band in a different direction starting around 2000. Today the band is a professional, well-oiled, working machine that specializes in Classic Rock and Country, but will also perform Latin & Contemporary Rock, but can still knock out of the park Big Band, Polkas, Waltzes and more upon request. Over the years the band has performed on cruise ships, numerous European countries and as far west as Colorado, amongst numerous other States. Everyone enjoys the variety this band offers including all the band members themselves!
