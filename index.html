<h3>What they’re saying…</h3>
<p>
“We were at two weddings you played for last year.  If we hadn’t booked your band for our wedding, we would’ve regretted it for the rest of our lives.” <br/>(Bride & her Fiancé)</p>

<p>
“You guys are the best band ever!”
<br/>(Attendee at wedding anniversary)</p>

<p>“You told me you didn’t know of another band that did everything you do.  Now I see how right you are.  You’re in a class of your own!  This is the first time in 30 years I have seen a band have to play an encore at a wedding…and you had to play two encores tonight!” <br/>(Father of the Bride)</p>

<p>“We hire your band year after year because there is no other band that does everything you do.” <br/>(Booking Agent)</p>

<p>“I was certain that if your band played for my wedding, no one would leave.  When I looked around at midnight, No one had left! What a party!<br/>(Groom at his wedding)</p>

<p>“….and Honey, he’s got a band too! <br/>(Actor James Earl Jones introducing Charlie to his wife backstage in his dressing room on Broadway, 2012)</p>

<p>“We book your band year after year because you are the favorite here.” <br/>(Booking agent)</p>

<p>“You guys never stop! You keep the crowd engaged and entertained non-stop!” <br/>(Waupaca Rotary Committee Member)</p>

<p>“Besides the obvious, a really tight band, you guys obviously enjoy what you’re doing” <br/>(Public Performance Attendee)</p>
